Push_Swap: Efficient Integer Sorting with Limited Operations (Turk Algorithm)

Description:

This repository implements the Push_Swap project, a challenge designed to hone algorithm design and optimization skills. The goal is to sort a list of integers using two stacks (a and b) and a restricted set of operations:

sa: Swap the top two elements of stack a.
sb: Swap the top two elements of stack b.
ss: Perform sa and sb simultaneously.
pa: Push the top element of stack b onto stack a.
pb: Push the top element of stack a onto stack b.
The project emphasizes achieving the sorting objective with the minimum number of operations. This implementation leverages the efficient Turk algorithm, renowned for its effectiveness in Push_Swap.

Key Features:

Efficient sorting: Utilizes the Turk algorithm to achieve optimal sorting within constraints.
Clarity and readability: Focuses on well-commented code for easy understanding and maintenance.
Testability: Includes unit tests to ensure code functionality and correctness.
